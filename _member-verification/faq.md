#### **What to do if an email is linked to multiple IDs?**

Sometimes a Member may have 2 or more memberships with the same registered email.

We realize each system works differently, but here’s a suggestion to tackle this issue:

- If only 1 ID is active, return that ID
- Else, return the last updated/used ID


#### **What does RJ do after a 404 response?**

We ask the RJ User to approach the Club’s front desk to add or change his or her email. Ideally, the new email is immediately accessible to the Member Verification web service.

This is convenient for the Club, since having Members’ correct emails is very valuable.

**// We can move this to the responses above.**

#### **What does RJ do after a 200 response?**

We send a verification link to the email. If the email is verified, we link the RJ User to his or her Member Unique ID. From that point forward, his or her Check-Ins automatically start counting toward the game.

**// We can move this to the responses above.**

#### **How does the Club Admin configure the Member Verification service?**

The Club Admin must input the web service's endpoint URL in the Settings tab of the Club's Control Center.

If you are a software provider, you must show the Club's Endpoint URL on your software's RocketJourney Configuration UI. *(Optional Mockups can be found later in this guide)*
