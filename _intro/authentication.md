For all requests to the RocketJourney Platform API, you need to provide the Club's Token inside a `X-RJ-Token` HTTP header.

For requests made by RocketJourney to your software, we will provide the same Club's Token inside a `X-RJ-Token` HTTP header. This is optional, but recommended.

You can find your Token on the Settings tab of your Control Center or, if you are a software provider, [contact us](mailto:support@rocketjourney) at [support@rocketjourney.com](mailto:support@rocketjourney) to receive one.
