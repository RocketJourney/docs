#### To offer RocketJourney to the members of a Club, your software has to be able to do 2 things:  

- **Member Verification**: Verify that a RJ User is a Member of the Club.
- **Check-In Verification**: Send Check-In information to RJ in real time.

If you are software provider for clubs, and want to make your software **RocketJourney Ready**, you'll also need to build a Configuration UI on your software's Admin Panel. This Configuration UI will allow the Club Admin to configure a connection between RocketJourney and your software.
